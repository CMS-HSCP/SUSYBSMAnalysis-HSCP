// ----------  Used codes ---------------------------

Code which produces the histograms for stability study, for calibration, ...
--> run2study.C  with minimal selection on the tracks and clusters
    run2analysis.C with almost final track selection

examples on how to run them : run2exe.C & run2exe2.C


Code to fit K and C:
--> FitKandC.C
  .L FitKandC.C
  FitKandC("name_of_the_file.root");

Codes to compute the Scale Factors:
--> makeProfilePlot2.C  [ making fit in place of profile,  makeProfilePlot.C is an intermediate development ]
  .L makeProfilePlot2.C
  GetSF();




//----------- old codes ---------------------------
Code to produce the template on top of the ntuples:
--> rundEdXtemplate.C
which calls dEdXtemplate.C

Starting code to play with the events:
--> GluinoAnalysis.C

Codes to compute the Scale Factors:
--> GetSF.C [ the one inspired by the HSCP analysis ]
