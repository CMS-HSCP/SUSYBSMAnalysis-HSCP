Code to produce the template on top of the ntuples:

--> rundEdXtemplate.C
which calls dEdXtemplate.C

Code to fit K and C:
--> FitKandC.C

Codes to compute the Scale Factors:
--> GetSF.C [ the one inspired by the HSCP analysis ]
--> makeProfilePlot2.C  [ making fit in place of profile,  makeProfilePlot.C is an intermediate development ]


Starting code to play with the events:
--> GluinoAnalysis.C
